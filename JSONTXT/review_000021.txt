    "negative_review": "Our room was an overrated disaster room 231 dirty smelly hot and very noisy of the banging doors in the corridor and from the other rooms We moved the couch a bid and the dirt and dust of months no cleaning appeared the smell of the gutter was very disturbing the lighting was too weak and a black bathroom is the worst design disaster one can imagine We found the whole hotel dirty dusty and dated To spend more then 243 Euros for a dirty attic room is daylight robbery",
