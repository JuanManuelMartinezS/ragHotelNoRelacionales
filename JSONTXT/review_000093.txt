    "positive_review": "Anyways the staff was extremely friendly no complants there Location of the hotel is about 1km from the nearest metro station The rooms were tidy and the beds were good to sleep in However there where several small faulty details unfinished renovation in the room like lamp on the floor nails sticking out of floor which rips your sock etc so nothing major but adding them all together it makes this as a three star hotel in my opinnion",
    "negative_review": "So lets start from the weird thing that happened in one of the rooms we were staying One person in our group got 220v electric chock which went through her hands It came from water boiler or lamp due to either a bad wireing faulty socket lamp or water boiler Luckily the rooms fuse discharged and cut the electricity in the room immediately The hotel covered doctor expences were very sorry about what had happened and send a fruit basket to a room They also let us have a late check out for free of charge Thats all of the compensation we had In my opinion the compensation was not that big for endangering a life of guest or what do you think The managemt had a chance to read and comment my review before i posted it The hotel management answered that this electric problem is now fixed but its still unclear if they checked other renovated rooms for faulty wireing too It anyway seems that the management does not worry about this that much since the management said that they did nor endanger any lives in the hotel Ofcource the managent was also very sorry in the answer about what had happened Some information gaps there seemed to be between the manager and the personnel since the cleaner came to ask us when are we leaving and the keys stopped working before the time we had been granted to leave Picture is from bathroom lamp that had nothing to do with the insident but such wireing was visible in the rooms",
