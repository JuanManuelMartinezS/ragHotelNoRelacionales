    "negative_review": "There were construction works at the front of the hotel but this didn t make much impact when inside However in the reception and all the way to the bottom floor lift was a strong eggy smell that I can only put down to the work outside It was abit gross but once we were by the actual rooms any sign of abnormal smell or noise were gone completely Considering it was a 4 star the room could have been abit neater ie The corners of the room were abit dusty the paint on the windows was cracking but there was nothing major",
